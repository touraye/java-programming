## Assignment3

Logical Operators

Instructions:

1. Create folder in your assignment folder called assignment3

2. Open IntelliJ 

3. Open your assignment3 folder as we demonstrated in class

4. Create a class called `LogicalOperator`, create a main method and print `logical operator` in the console to test your Java Application

5. Create four variables of type integer(int)

6. ```java
   int a = 30;
   int b = 20;
   int c = 4;
   int d = 15;
   //hint for number 7 - 11
   boolean check = a > b || c < d;//ture
   System.out.println("is " +a+ " > " +b+ " || " +c+ " < " +d+ " = " +check);
   ```

7. Use comparison operators to compare your variables, and use logical operators to perform some logics on your Booleans 

8. Write an expression that will describe `a is less than b and c less than or equals to d`

9. Write an expression that will describe `a is less than b and c less than or equals to d`

10. Write an expression that will describe `not a is greater than or equals b or c is less than or equals to d`
