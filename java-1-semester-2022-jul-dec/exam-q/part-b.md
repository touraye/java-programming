1. QCELL offers a great and easy our ways of buying cash-power straight from you mobile phone. Consider creating a similar application in Java. These App will prompt users to choose options from A, B, and C. Option A if for 35, option B is 55, and option C is 95.

​	If user choose the option A print them a message to the console "Your bought GMD35" as well as option B 	and C

​	If user pick a different choose from the above options the program should be tell the person he/she 		                	 "You do make any transaction".

2. A. Create a Java Application that will accept student mark and determine whether he/she is A student, B student, C student, D student, E student or F student

​		A student 90 -100 

​		B student 75 - 89

​		C student 60 - 74

​		D student 49 - 59

​		E student 40 - 48

​		F student 0 - 39

​	B. List all the comparison operators in Java

3. Consider the code below,

```java
public class Student{
   private String studentNumber;
   private String name;
   private double gpa;  
}
```

​		A. Create a getters and setters for each of the instance variables

​		B. Implement a method called gpaChecker, this method will take gpa as a argument and return true if the 			gpa is equals to or more than 2.5  , and false if less than 2.5

​		C. Create Tester class to test your application


4. Given the array of int[] points = {55, 69, 90, 98, 77, 86, 40}; 

   A. print out the length of the points array

   B. Implement a Java logic to read all the items found in the points arrays

   C. create a total variable to sum all item in the points array

5. Implement a Java program that will ask user to enter their PIN Number. 

   If the user enter the right pin you print a welcome message and terminate the program

   If user enter a wrong PIN print an error message and ask them again for two more time, if they still cannot enter the right PIN terminate the program. User have three times to be entering a wrong PIN.

6. A. What is a method?

   B. What is Class?

   C List, explain and give example of the three logical operators

7. A. What is Constructor and give example?

​	   B. What is object and give example?

   	C. Differentiate a local from a global variable
