# Programing(Java 1) 1 Assignment 2

Due Date: Check on the Google classroom

Utilize `Scanner` to take input from user and use Arithmetic operator to complete question 1:

1. Create a Java project called assignment2

   1. Create package called `ass1` 

   2. Create a Java class called `ArithmeticOperation` and `main` method.

   3. Consider a scanner object `Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);`

   4. Prompt the user to enter a value `System.out.print("Enter num 1: ");`

   5. Create a variable called `num1` and store the number entered by the user(you) like so; `int num1 = scan.nextInt();`. 

   6. Create another variable called `num`2 and repeat the same process in `e`.

   7. Declare five variables of type `int` namely `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division`, and `modules`. Assign each variable with an arithmetic expression using `num` and `num2`. The name of the variable determine the arithmetic operator you will use in your arithmetic expression.

   8. Your program output:

      ```java
      3 + 5 = 8
      ```

2. Imagine you are given a task as a programmer to print employee details: 

   ```java
   Employee Detail:
   Emp ID: 2024-9343
   Emp Name: Lamin Bah
   Emp Department: HR
   Emp Salary: 16000.0
   ```

   Create a package called `ass2`, a class with a name of `EmployeeDetail` and a main method. The `Emp ID` value `2024-` is hardcoded but 9343 is generated using `Random` class. Consider using `Random` class and append it to `Emp ID` using concatenation technique.

3. Create a package called `ass3`  and Java class called `ComparisonOperators`. Using the code snippet `System.out.println("2 > 3: " +(2 > 3));` as example. Provide print statements for all of the comparison operators with any desire numbers.

Happy coding!
