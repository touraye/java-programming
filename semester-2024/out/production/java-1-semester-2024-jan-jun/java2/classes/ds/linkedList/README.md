# LinkedList Data Structure
Unlike arrays where data is stored in a continuous memory location, rather than data is stored separately but, each point to the next or previous depending on the type of LinkedList. In LinkedList, the actual data is stored in the heap memory while their references are stored in the stack memory.

## Properties of a LinkedList
The actual implementation of a LinkedList is class with properties and behavior. So, therefore, a LinkedList is a class with properties like `head`, `tail`, optional `size`, and a `Node` class.

## Behavior of a LinkedList
A LinkedList class can have lots of operations is can perform such as to add item to, to remove item and to display the items. These are the three basic operations on a LinkedList. However, both add and remove can be more broad. Adding item on a LinkedList can be at the first or last pace or even at any pace. These can be the same for removing an item from a LinkedList.
