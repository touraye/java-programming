Good Luck!

   3. False

2. Exception helps programmers to catch errors.

   4. None of the above

3. Every Java statement must end with a semicolon.

   1. *True*
   2. False

4. An expression statements that involve the use of an Arithmetic operator, are called.

   2. *Arithmetic expression*
   3. Math.floor
   4. None of the above

5. The ternary operator is interchangeably used with__

   1. Switch statement
   2. If and Else statement
   3. Single statement
   4. Print statement

6. The type of error that prevents a code from compiling is called.

   1. Syntax error
   2. Runtime error
   3. Logical error
   4. None of the above

7. A class in Java is said to be__

   1. A blueprint where objects are created from
   2. Place where Java codes are executed
   3. A file to write codes
   4. Statement end with a semicolon

8. A switch statement takes a single variable as a condition.

   1. True
   2. False

9. Consider the code snippet below and choose the right option:

   ```java
   System.out.println(Math.max(10, 9));
   ```

   What will be printed from the above method call?

   1. 10
   2. 9
   3. 0
   4. 19

10. Study the code snippets below carefully and choose the right option.

    ```java
    int count = 5;
    if(count <= 5){
        count++;
    }
    System.out.println(count)
    ```

    1. 5
    2. 6
    3. 0
    4. 4

11. A data structure that has a fixed size and cannot be resized is said to be__

    1.  String
    2. Array
    3. ArrayList
    4. Char

12. The logical &&(AND) operation is said to be strict when comparing Boolean values and therefore, it will only execute when both sides are__

    1. True
    2. False

13. Which of the String methods is considered to be case sensitivity when comparing two String?

    1. `equalsIgnoreCase()`
    2. `equals()`
    3. `substring()`
    4. `length()`

14. Study the below code snippet carefully and choose the right option.

    ```java
    for(int i 0; i < 5; i++){
        System.out.println(i);
        
        if(i > 3)
            break;
    }
    ```

    What are the values of `i` that are going to be printed in the console?

    1. `1 2 3`
    2. `1 2 3 4`
    3. `0 1 2 3 4`
    4. `0 1 2 3 4 5`

15. What is the other name for logical operators?

16. A function or method in programming are subroutine that executes a task when__

    1. Called

    2. Written

    3. Executed

    4. Run

17. ```java
    int count = 1;
    while(true){
    	System.out.println("Hello World!")
        count++;
        
        if(count <= 7)
            break;
    }
    ```

    How many times will the above `while loop` print `Hello World!` to the console:

    2. 0 time

    3. 7 times

    4. 8 times

18. Accessing elements from Arrays using__

    1. Names

    2. Number

    4. Points

19. Consider the code snippets below: 

    ```java
    String[] productList = {"banna", "bread", "milk", "sugar", "apple", "egg"};
    ```

    To print "milk" from the `productList`, pick the correct option:

    1. `System.out.println(productList[1])`

    2. `System.out.println(productList[2])`

    3. `System.out.println(productList[3])`

    4. `System.out.println(productList[0])`

20. ```java
    static int add(int val1, int val2){
            int ans = val1 + val2;
            return  ans;
        }
    ```
