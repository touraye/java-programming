# Java Home Exercise

Here you are going to build a simple Java application called `MyProgramExpenseApp` with your little programming knowledge.

Create your a new Java project called `MyProgramExpenseApp`, new class `MyProgramExpenseApp` and a main method.

Your program need to display your `full-name`, `student-number`, `program-name`, `number-of-semester`,`semester-cost`, `transport-cost`, `lunch-cost`, and `days-you-go-to-school` .

After creating all the required type of the above mention variables(please be aware of Java naming conventions!).

You need to calculate the following:

* Calculate your `weekly-transport-cost`
* Calculate your `monthly-transport-cost`
* Calculate your `semester-transport-cost`
* Calculate your `weekly-lunch-cost`
* Calculate your `monthly-lunch-cost`
* Calculate your `semester-lunch-cost`
* Calculate your `total-program-cost`
* Calculate your expected expenditure for the entire program. These includes your transport, lunch, as well as total program fee.

Demo:

```java
******** My Program Expense App ********
Full Name: Ahmed Dicko
Student number: 2023-001
Program Name: Computer science
Number of Semeters: My program consist of 4 semesters
Semester Cost: Each semester I pay GMD12500.0
Transport Cost: Each day i spent GMD118.0 on transport
Lunch Cost: Each day i spent GMD50.0 on food
My Shool days: I go to school 3 times in a week
 /*Calculate below values*/
 Weekly transport cost:
 Monthly transport cost:
 Semester transport cost:
 Weekly lunch cost:
 Monthly lunch cost:
 Semester lunch cost:
Total Program Cost: 
Expected Entire Program Expenditure: 
```

Please try to put your correct information. Let's make it fun, coding should be fun!

Happy coding!
