# Week 2

Prerequisites: No programming knowledge is required, just basic computing skills. 

Topics to the cover:
* Variable concept
* Data types in Java
* Naming convention in Java
* String class

**Variable** is store or container that hold a value inside a computer memory, These value can be a a name of a person, age of a person, bank-account balance, a truthy of a falsely value etc. The term `variable` means that the value can varies meaning it can change. But, not all the values of a variable can be change in the scope of the program some do not change their values when declared, but in most case they do. For case of simplicity a variable also have some other things attached to it; name and a value.

In a strong-type languages like Java every variable most have a `type, name, value`. These is not the case for other programming language like python, JavaScript where a variable only have a name and a value.

In programming a variable have two stages:
Initialization stage, and Declaration stage

### Initialization  Stage

These stage is when a variable doesn't have an initial value.  A container is created and it's content is provided. 

#### Declaration Stage

These stage is when a variable is given an initial value. In a more precise way it means when a container is created and it doesn't have no content in it.

#### Assignment

These happens automatically when you initialized a variable with the use of equals `=` sign, and can also come in when you wan to assign a declared variable with a new value.

#### Reassignment

Reassignment is the exact opposite of assignment. Reassignment happens when you have given variable a value and you then want to remove the old value and put in a new value(think of it as an update to a variable).

 It must have an initial value before you can actually reassignment it with a new value

#### Variable in Strong Type and Lose Type Languages 

Not all languages deal with variable the same. As we know that there are two type of programming languages `strong, lose type`. Do not be taken by the name 'strong and lose', I am not saying any language been powerful over the other. All language their strength 

### Strong Type Language

In a strong type language every variable most have a type(data type), name, and a value

### Lose Type Language

In a lose type language a variable is not mandatory to have a type they only have `name` and `value`, a variable could have a number as it's value and it can change to another type like string.

#### Variable Been Constant

In a program when a variable is said to be a constant that means the variable value cannot be change at any given time in a program. Constant is good for identity number, student number thing that do not change or will not change. A constant variable has a special keyword that let the program knows about it, and these is different with programming languages.

## Data Types in Java

In Java, there are two type of namely primitive and non-primitive or referential data types
